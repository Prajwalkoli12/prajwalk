 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">It's beautiful and we have the opportunity to do whatever we desire. The big blue sky with the sun's rays shining through fluffy clouds. Mountains which reach the sky like a stairway to heaven. Travelling and exploring new places is an incredible experience if you have the chance. With everything being so expensive, it's difficult for some people to go on adventures around the globe.</font></p> 
 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">Wouldn't you love to see the Great Wall of China; the northern lights; or the Grand Canyon? I know I would!</font></p> 

 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">Why do people travel? Is it just for a business meeting or to see the family? There are hundreds of reasons. My reason is, for being a tourist, exploring and enjoying learning about other countries and their cultures and traditions.</font></p> 
 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white"> As someone once said, 'the world is your oyster''. We should embrace it, and take advantage of what we have been given. Whether you believe it or not. </font></p> 
 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">God made this incredible place for us. Seeing all the power He has and its beauty gives a feeling of awe. Stunning sights take my breath away! Is it not interesting finding out how other people live their everyday lives which they take for granted? It is as if they are blinded by the beauty around them</font></p> .



 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">I have wonderful memories and stories of all these places. I dream of more places like those! They were all times of being with my family. However annoying and irritating they may be, its fun! When I am lying on my death bed, these are the things I hope to think off. </font></p> 
 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">You cannot say that you do not want to feel the way I do, about visiting these remarkable places. There are thousands more too. Near where you live and far far away in unknown lands... Some of the most astonishing places are the unexpected and hidden places.</font></p> 

 <p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">Be brave and let loose your desires!  </font></p>
		<p align="center"><font size="4" color="white">Taste new foods even if you think you wont like them. You may be surprised... Take photos. Explore and take more photos. The memories are treasures! The best thing to do is to go to a city for one day.  </font></p>
		<p align="center"><font size="4" color="white"> You'll feel a rush to go everywhere, but relax. Its supposed to be fun. You'll never forget those extravagant and eccentric landmarks, food or even the people.</font></p>
