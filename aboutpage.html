<p><font size="5">Namaste, Guten Tag!
I'm Sonal from India, living in Germany and exploring Europe. I've been writing about my travels since 2015. I often travel alone (and sometimes with family of 3).

I love European city breaks, nature, adventure, hiking to viewpoints, Yoga, and road trips. I have a think for creating the most amazing travel itineraries and in-depth destination guides which will help you make the most of your trip.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">I moved to Germany in 2017 (yay!). So, as a person living in Europe, I present to you my best tips, information and itineraries for traveling in this continent.

My way of traveling is not to just visit a place to check it off the list. I try to get my way of getting my best travel experience of that place.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">So what’s that like? I like viewpoints, affordable local food, room with a view, good coffee, best photo spots, sunset spots, and just some little things that make my visit extra special. And yes, that’s exactly the kind of stuff I share in my destination guides on my website.</font></p>
