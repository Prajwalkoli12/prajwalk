<p><font size="5">Vietnam is best explored by bus. What’s the great thing about these Vietnamese buses is that you can buy open tickets which are perfect for an unplanned traveler such as myself.So, exploring Vietnam on my own, turned out to be a cake walk, thanks to the transport all sorted through these open bus tickets.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">You can travel from north to south or visa versa and stop at any of the major cities for as long as you want</font></p>
