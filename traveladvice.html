<p><font size="5">Do you find travel planning overwhelming and time consuming?

We're here to help.

Travel has been our lifestyle for over 22 years now - most of that involved nomadic full tine travel.

We made it work as solo travelers, travel as a couple, expat travelers,  family travelers, and location independent travelers.

We have lived in 5 countries and traveled to over 50, in-depth through Australia, USA, Southeast Asia,UK, and Africa.

We aim to share with you information based upon personal experiences NOT desk research or collaborations!

This is real, authentic travel to help you do the same.</font></p>
